    With <a href="https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~aephraim/">A. Steinberg</a> (UofT), I was first exposed to the physical limits of information processing in quantum information science.
    Inspired by the science of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9911.html">successful forays of physicists into biology</a>, I realized neuroscience offers a fascinating area to articulate this idea. With <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/58058.html">F. Wolf</a> at the Max Planck Institute of Dynamics and Self-organization, I focused my attention on the dynamics of neural circuits.
    I then rounded out my biology and data analysis while developing inference frameworks for probabilistic models of adaptive immune repertoires with <a href="https://www.phys.ens.fr/~awalczak/">A. Walczak</a> and <a href="http://www.phys.ens.fr/~tmora/">T. Mora</a> at ENS' Physics department in Paris.
</p>

<p>
    Emerging from this training with the sense that the dynamics of inference serves as a powerful lens to understand learning systems, I returned to Canada in 2018 on an <a href="https://ivado.ca/en">IVADO</a> post-doctoral fellowship to work on dynamical systems approaches to deep learning in recurrent neural networks supervised by <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/yoshua-bengio/">Y. Bengio</a> (UdeM) and <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~lajoie/">G. Lajoie</a> (UdeM).
    It became clear to me that forming good representations is intricately linked to what decisions they serve. I started a collaboration with <a href="http://www.cisek.org/pavel/">P. Cisek</a> (UdeM) in which I used bounded rational RL agent models to provide the first reward-rate optimal solution of the decades-old 'tokens task' studied in his lab and to show the particular way in which the macaques in the dataset I analyzed behave suboptimally on the task. This normative approach ignores their social milieu: an attentive, yet controlling human providing juice according to an opaque rule varying over longer timescales in a non-transparent way. Stepping towards realism, I articulated a heuristic strategy more robust to an adversary and that gives a quantitative match to behaviour and a qualitative match to neural activity used to validate the fitted models. This outcome reinforced to me the importance of acknowledging the social factors at play in any given decision-making context.

    Wanting a deeper understanding of reinforcement learning theory, I joined the <a href="https://www.irina-lab.ai/">Excellence Research Cluster on Autonomous AI</a> led by Irina Rish. Here, I focused on understanding the sources of limitations of prominent RL algorithms in the non-stationary, multi-task setting of continual learning, especially in multi-agent systems, and worked on problem formulation aspects as well as efficient architecture design.
<br>
<br>
    <b>Transitioning from Neuroscience to Applied Social Science</b>
<br>
<br>
    For other reasons, during this time, I started learning about climate change (documented <a href="climaction.html">here</a>). I realized how serious the problem is and, with my skillset of data-driven modelling, how I might contribute. I joined and worked on setting up Climate Match. I also started moving away from neuroscience and towards questions that seemed relevant to our predictament that seemed to lie in the social sciences. I identified text as a key data source and topic modelling was a natural approach since the models are actually quite similar to (because they were in fact first published in!) genetic sequence models and generative modelling work I had done in immune repertoires. This got me interested in the text-as-data paradigm of computational social science. Combined with multi-agent systems modelling, these methods are primed to advance the science of society. I found that the <a href="https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io/">Complex Data Lab</a> was doing similar flavor of work and that I could contribute my modelling expertise. Happy to say that I am finally realizing the kind of work that I envisioned could done. I hope to be able to continue to focus on impact.
