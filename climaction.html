<em>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</em>
<br>- Marie Curie
<br>
<br>
<!-- I was starting to see mainstream, credentialed experts giving 10-20 year timelines for last-chance, system-changing climate action. How could that be true? Many institutions have plans that extend into and even beyond that time frame, and most have no stated intention to make the kind of drastic and urgent action demanded by being on the precipice of the end of civilization. Heck, my own career aspirations and those of most professionals I know extend into that time frame. Is climate change really going to kibosh them all? "That <em>can't</em> be true," I thought. And yet, I found myself thinking about climate change often but without much understanding of what it was, other than probably a very hard and important problem. I finally got fed up with not knowing. If this is really something that experts think is going to determine the future of everything, then it's relevant to every career-aspiring professional and to any career I would want to pursue! So, I set out to learn about it, at least enough to be able to answer the question:  -->
<!-- It seems a majority of experts on society and where we're going think climate change is going to determine the future of everything. 
That makes it relevant to every career-aspiring professional and to every career aspiration. 
 --><!-- I would want to pursue There are mainstream, credentialed experts giving 10-20 year timelines for last-chance, system-changing action to address the <em>climate emergency</em>. That's rather soon! --> 
We are hearing more and more from experts about how climate change is going to determine the near-future of everything. What's the basis of these statements? Some questions I had are: 
<ul>
<li><b><em>What are the main drivers of climate change that inform such projections?</em></b></li>
<li><b><em>What are and when will be the effects in a business-as-usual projection?</em></b></li>
<li><b><em>What action can we take that is meaningful, accessible, and effective?</em></b></li>
</ul>
I sought answers that both (1) are backed by solid data with transparent and unbiased, if large uncertainty estimates, and (2) grapple with the real-life complexity of human behaviour and of the existing socio-economic/geo-political order. The contents of this page are a on-going synthesis of what I've found.

<em>Note</em>: If you'd rather just jump to learning about what you can do, I suggest reading a pair of posts from JT Olio about <a href="https://www.jtolio.com/2022/07/anthropocene-calamity-part-3-every-part-of-the-pie-must-shrink/">what the average person can do </a> and <a href="https://www.jtolio.com/2022/07/anthropocene-calamity-part-4-your-pie-chart-looks-different-than-others/#:~:text=Each%20person%20has,amount%20of%20leverage.">what you, in particular, can do</a>. There is something actionable for everyone!
<br>
<br>
<div class="box">
Here's the <b><em>TL;DR Summary</em></b> on the state of the climate emergency:
<ul>
<li><u><em>The physics of the problem is simple: an Earth Energy Imbalance</em></u>. The earth absorbs light energy from the sun and re-emits energy as heat back into space. A fraction of this heat is trapped on earth by greenhouse gases (GHGs). How much? <a href="https://gcos.wmo.int/en/news/where-does-heat-go#:~:text=The%20Earth%20Energy%20Imbalance%20(EEI,bringing%20climate%20change%20under%20control.">0.87 +/- 0.12 joule/second/meter<sup>2</sup></a>. This is alot! It's an energy rate equivalent to every 10x10 km<sup>2</sup> patch of land (e.g. the size of a big city) getting hit at different locations every 2 weeks by a <a href="https://youtu.be/3wxWNAM8Cso?list=RDCMUC2ccm1GajfSujz7T18d7cKA&t=214">Hiroshima bomb</a> (blast area approx. 8 km<sup>2</sup>), such that the blasts cover all the land on Earth every 6 months. Most of this heat is actually absorbed by the oceans, but that capacity isn't limitless, is having its own cascading sequence of negative effects, and the relatively small remainder that gets absorbed and held by the land and atmosphere is still large enough to present an existential problem for us. We need to lower the GHG concentration in the atmosphere so more heat can escape. Instead, <b>we are increasing GHG concentration by burning fossil fuels, which traps more heat.</b></li>
<br>
<li><u><em>It's worse than you think</em></u>. The underlying physical and socio-political mechanisms at play in climate change make the worst case projections both more probable and worse than I imagined and the year-to-year adjustments in projected timelines for serious changes keep moving closer. Tending to be situated in more affected regions and with less means to protect themselves, more and more poor countries are seeing the effects of climate change. This a global problem, however. From extreme weather to unavailable essential products, changes to everyday life are starting to pop-up this decade even for rich countries and are projected to become more frequent over the next decades. These near-term impacts are largely unavoidable given that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/3/031001">climate responds slowly over decades</a>. The high uncertainty and tail risk in what happens after 2050 merits <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119">considering worst-case scenarios</a>. For example, on our current business-as-usual trajectory the effects could compound into what will mark the beginning of the end of our civilization as we know it (e.g. conflict-causing mass migration and food/water shortages from regions made uninhabitable/infertile, irreparable dysregulation of the global economy, etc.). In the worst case, civilization on this trajectory will be a rapidly decomposing shell of itself coming out of this century. <b>The meaningful action for us to take is to ensure civilization doesn't collapse.</b> </li>
<br>
<li> <u><em>There are still credible paths forward that avoid collapse. They demand systemic change, soon, the seeds of which are being sowed now</em></u>.
After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth#:~:text=The%20Limits%20to%20Growth%20(LTG,the%20earth%20and%20human%20systems">half a century</a> of not having major impact, the vibrant science and societal movement to thread the needle to a sustainable future is burgeoning and now seems poised to make real headway. The work of this movement exudes for me a vision and resolve that is characteristic of the best of the human spirit. It gives me hope that preventing collapse is a realistic goal. Make no mistake, the stakes are everything and the hard work is ahead of us. We are fighting against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wickedest</a> of problems: the imposing cynicism of autocratic petrostates, the distracted governance of emerging populism, and the soothing, but deluded doctrine of continual growth through tech innovation. Nevertheless, in the spirit of Marie Curie, better understanding this complex arena allows us to form and execute better shots at success. I feel empowered by this idea to act out of my comfort zone and maybe you can be too. There's no sugar-coating it: the alternative of staying complacent makes us complicit in the current inertia destroying most everything of permanence any of us ever cared about (soon enough to watch it happen if we are young enough to live another 40 years). This includes dooming most living things (e.g. our children) to brutish, short lives. <b>Embrace the discomfort, and channel it into action bold enough to resolve the dissonance.</b> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- I've been disheartened at the degree to which ideology in our institutions (finally now shifting) seems to have contributed to us walking into this crisis. I am also frustrated by the Academy's lack of bold action. Climate change poses a credible existential threat and yet we academics are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_effect
">keeping our heads in the sand</a>. I'm no radical, but understand why <a href="https://scientistrebellion.com/">some scientists</a> have decided to break out of everyday complaining and do something more substantial. This page is a small attempt at seeding more and greater action.<br>-->

<h0 id="features" padding=0>Salient features of this complex problem</h0>
<br>
<br>
Below is a list I've compiled of what to me seem like important features/impacts of the climate emergency, organized by sector. <br>
A more pedagogical slides-based video-lecture version of most of this content (filled with eye-catching graphs!) is linked to <a href="#videos">below</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<em>Disclaimer</em>: While I've aimed to be thorough, any such list is surely incomplete and subjective! I'm happy to take suggestions for additional content.

<br>
<br>
Economics/Finance:
<ul>
<li> Neo-classical economic analyses <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856?journalCode=rglo20">systematically underestimate</a> climate risk so take those projections as overly optimistic. </li>
<li> A <a href="https://www.ngfs.net/en">significant portion</a> of the financial industry regulators see the value that will be lost in a business-as-usual projection. They are mostly on board with large, asset-stranding changes.</li>
<li> The goal is for a so-called <em>orderly</em> transition off fossil fuels along which companies have the opportunity to plan. This is contrasted with a <em>disorderly</em> transition characterizes by frequent shocks that disrupt the economy.
<li> While a tax on pollution is unpopular (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01268-3">even with rebates!</a>), it is the <a href="https://ecofiscal.ca/">best economic device we have</a>. Instead of sticks, carrot (i.e. positive reward)-based policy is in the works, e.g. a <a href="https://globalcarbonreward.org/carbon-currency/">carbon coin/currency</a>. 
<li> The fossil fuel industry lobby has, however, been effective at protecting their intention to continue production into the next decades. E.g. the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/18/climate-change-inflation-reduction-act-oil-gas/7837956001/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which further develops the renewable energy sector, also grants the fossil fuel industry many benefits. </li>
<li> The degree to which economic growth can be decoupled from physical resources is a complex, ideology-laden debate (the two sides even differ in <a href="https://twitter.com/ryankatzrosene/status/1575197065575272448?s=20&t=Y8ORKZdvx-K2ZeUUML4cjg">what decoupling means</a>) that nevertheless seems to have an empirical resolution: there are lots of examples of partial decoupling (e.g. within the economies of specific nations, even when exported emissions are included), but the kind of global decoupling that would make current rates of growth consistent with a sustainable future <a href="https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Decoupling-Debunked.pdf">seems unlikely</a>. </li>
<!-- <li>It is mostly cheap oil, rather human ingenuity that supports the high rates of consumption in the developed world.</li>  -->
<li> Cheap oil is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261921011673">waning</a> and energy sources are diversifying. The latter aren't as rich as oil though, so expect economic contraction globally, because the viability of many business models and lifestyles depend on cheap energy and a low cost of carbon. This economic contraction will likely <a href="https://dro.dur.ac.uk/36769/1/36769.pdf?DDD35+khcv89+vbdv77">adversely impact our efforts</a> to further develop and deploy renewable energy.</li>
<li> New kinds of financial instruments are being developed to facilitate internalizing the costs of pollution. One such idea is a <a href="https://globalcarbonreward.org/carbon-currency/">carbon currency</a>.</li>
</ul>

Technology:
<ul>
    <li>New technologies must scale well to be useful solutions (e.g. sourced material for any physical product must be plentiful and cheap on a global scale). Very few do. Moreover, efficiency claims should be based on the entire manufacturing and product life cycle process, not just what the technology delivers.</li>
<li> Be skeptical of Tech solutionism. That model hasn't proved itself yet in these large-scale, poorly grounded coordination problems, and "moving fast and breaking things" is a philosophy that actively generates and ignores externalities, which is largely what got us here. </li>
</ul>

Energy Sector:
<ul>
    <li> Our current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption">global energy consumption rate</a> of 17 terawatts (17 x 10<sup>12</sup> watts!) is supported mostly by burning fossil fuels. The bulk of this consumption, and thus of fossil fuel emissions, is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00955-z">concentrated in affluent countries and affluent individuals</a>. Despite large increases in efficiency over the last 50 years, per-capita energy consumption has not declined but leveled off since the 1970s. With our population slated to grow by a few more billion, the additional energy required to satisfy that per-capita rate is more than all currently produced renewable energy.</li>
    <li> Era of cheap oil is coming to an end. <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-26372-4">Peak production</a> is in a decade or so, followed by gradual decline.</li>
    <li>There's consensus coal needs to be phased out but large and increasing consumption in India and China is offsetting coal reductions elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Scope 1 (emissions from inputs) and 2 (emissions in production) of the Energy sector are large, but still dwarf scope 3 (emissions from output product) - the processed fossil fuel itself. There are lots of means for the sector to evade emissions reduction. For example, as <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24102022/fossil-fuels-private-equity/">dirty assets become a liability</a>, there will always buyers and this off-loading presents problems for tracking and transparency. </li>
</ul>

Politics:
<ul>
<li> Given <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/20/4/4/95068/Prisoners-of-the-Wrong-Dilemma-Why-Distributive">the track record</a>, it's mostly domestic lobbying and economic interests that shape climate policies political leaders campaign on and push for.</li>
<li> Domestic climate politics is increasingly partisan with support for climate policies such as carbon pricing divided along ideological lines.
<li> Fossil-fuel producing nations are increasingly autocratic/oligarchic and kleptocratic. They will exert control over pricing via rates of production to slow-burn the extraction of as much of their remaining reserves as possible to maximize their profits. Avoiding civilizational collapse needs most of these reserves to stay in the ground. These actors are thus perhaps the largest impediment to mitigating climate change. The emerging alliance between Russia and Saudi Arabia is a timely example of large producers/emitters that will be hard for the international community to compel to leave reserves in the ground. </li>
<li> Increased resource scarcity will embolden and empower aggressor states that will put increasing pressure on world order and peace. 
<li> As our institutions become more pliable in response to the calls for change, all actors will try to manipulate the process to their advantage. We need increased institutional strength and agility, not reduced institutional oversight.</li>

<li> As we saw with the pandemic response, a good solution can fail to be implemented effectively. We need to translate the vision and commitment we currently have at large scale global scales back down to the scales of nations and peoples. </li>
</ul>

Public perception:
<ul>
<li> Collectively, we are uninformed. In the developed world, we think climate change is about personal choices not systemic change.</li>
<li> Concern about climate change and even knowledge about it isn't a great predictor of what changes we are willing to accept.</li>
<li> We seem to want an effective and fair transition, for others and for ourselves.</li>
<li> We are more swayed by explanations of how proposed policies do this rather than by explanations of the climate impacts these policies aim to mitigate. We are also swayed our culpability, when communicated clearly. </li>
<li> Feelings and values influence our decision-making and will affect how we evaluate explanations of outcomes.</li>
<li>The research field of AI alignment/safety is obviously concerned with future risk, but tends to downplay risk due to climate change in favor of risk due current and especially soonish AI technologies. While these latter risks are certainly there, I don't think the research and tech infrastructure needed to develop advanced AI can exist in a business-as-usual projection, so I am less concerned about AI's existential risk. Personally, my biggest concern about the negative impact of near-term AI is simply its effect on public discourse and democracy, e.g. from continued active and passive curation of public opinion by the existing AI (e.g. recommender systems).</li>
</ul>

Biosphere:
<ul>
<li> A mass extinction event was already underway independent of the effects of climate change due to human activities like habitat destruction. </li>
<li> Climate change accelerates and exacerbates this trend, with an estimated half of all (pre-industrial) species going extinct by 2050. </li>
<li> Two stark examples: (1) the Arctic marine ecosystem may be completely destroyed by the loss of sea ice (on the underside of which is the algae forming the bottom of its food chain), and (2) the southwest of the Amazon rain forest will likely transition to savannah by 2050.</li>
<li> The biosphere's resilience is collective, so it is an important goal to do what is possible to conserve remaining species and habitats.</li> 
</ul>

Climate:
<ul>
<li>It is important to remember that net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> and the eventual reduced atmospheric temperature is an important target, but not the whole story. The fundamental symptom of the crisis is the <em>Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI)</em>: more greenhouse gases in our atmosphere mean that less of the energy we absorb from the sun is radiated away so the earth (mostly the oceans) are absorbing this excess heat. There are other greenhouse gases (like methane) and there are other consequences to climate (ocean warming) that we also need to keep in mind. Temperature changes can also have large effects on how bodies absorb or give off carbon dioxide (e.g. there are large and consequential uncertainties in how land-based carbon sinks are going to respond to warming going forward).
<li> While the convention is to track climate change with average temperature increase, it is the weather variability that is also growing in most locations and is the largest source of risk to us. For example, heatwaves, even short ones if strong, can have lasting effects on the human population and the crops that sustain it.</li>
<li> Strongest effects are heterogeneously distributed over the planet and capacity to adapt at a given location depends on socio-economic status up to a point. Unlikely any group or place will come out better than they are now. The typical case will be significantly worse.</li>
<li> In many cases, the change in official projections year by year continue to be in the worsening direction. The IPCC report only <a href="https://climatetippingpoints.info/2021/10/31/ipcc-ar6-climate-tipping-points-feedbacks/">started discussing</a> tipping points in earnest last year, of which many seem to be approaching <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abn7950">much faster than anticipated</a>.</li>
<li> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been coupled with aerosol emissions, which have masked and delayed the full warming and precipitation effects. Temperatures are likely to rise more quickly in the coming years as we emit less aerosols. Let's not get frazzled by this and instead prepare adaptation measures now.</li>
<li> Geo-engineering to pull CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere will likely be necessary. Geo-engineering to reflect sunlight away in the meantime will also be needed (See the schematic below from MacMartin & Kravitz <em>PNAS</em> (2018)). There are still many unknowns, so we need a Manhattan project for this and, when deemed necessary, start with the safest, accessible approaches.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<h0 id="responses" padding=0>Common positions taken in response to the climate emergency</h0>
<br>
<br>
<em>Degrowthers</em>: Reduce consumption and preserve the natural world that sustains us.
<ul>
<li> Pro: This is the right goal. A sustainability-oriented society is where we need to end up.</li>
<li> Con: It is unclear how to overcome high initial social & structural barriers.
</li>
</ul>
<em>Ecomodernists</em>: Transition off fossil fuels by innovating technological solutions through further growth.
<ul>
<li> Pro: Markets (for capitalists) and emancipated Labour (for socialists) are powerful forces for technological innovation.</li>
<li> Con: It is unclear how to globally decouple this growth from further degradation of the environment on which we depend.
</li>
</ul>
<em>Deep Adaptationists</em>: Not salvagable. Accept what's coming and focus on reducing harm.
<ul>
<li> Pro: Counter-intuitively, they provide an activating psychology that empowers in face of climate emergency. </li>
<li> Con: Near-total societal collapse is often baked in as an axiom. That's unjustified and distracting given current uncertainties.
</li>
</ul>
Ideally, the future climate movement will combine the best parts of each of these 3 main contemporary camps, while addressing their limitations. There is a clear measurable goal that this movement should rally around. It's summarized in the following graphic:

  <br>
  <center>Modified from MacMartin & Kravitz <em>PNAS</em> (2018), this graphic sketches what success would look like by breaking the solution down into the three main components: emission reductions, CO<sub>2</sub> removal, & solar radiation management. Each of these will require massive technological innovation and behavioural change. </center>

<!-- Global warming (what climate change really means) is the  of problems! It is masked in myriad ways and exploits the deepest flaws in our society's and our own capacity to adapt. --> 
Contextualized as a nasty side-effect of conventional growth economics, I've made a series of four research videos that outline the problem. The last one is about how I think my skillset can contribute.
