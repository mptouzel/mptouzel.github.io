<em>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</em> 
<br>- Marie Curie
<br>
<br>
Are you overwhelmed by climate change? So was I, and I didn't even know what it was, other than probably a very hard and important problem. I wondered: what meaningful action can we (you and I) take as individuals? 
<br>
<br>
This resource page is the fruit of a learning process I went through wrapping my head around climate change and what we can do about it (not for everyone, but definitely helpful for those like me that probably score high on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_cognition#:~:text=Need%20for%20cognition%20has%20been,idea%20evaluation%2C%20and%20problem%20solving">need for cognition</a>). I found the worst cases are as bad or worse than I imagined and I've been disheartened at the degree to which ideology in our institutions (finally now shifting) seems to have contributed to us walking into this crisis. Others are doing <a href="https://www.jtolio.com/2022/07/anthropocene-calamity-part-1-holy-shit-things-are-super-bad/
">their own process</a> and coming to similar conclusions. The fact that the academy isn't more active on this existential problem is frustrating. It gives the impression that all the knowledge generation just performative. Even for the players of the game motivated by scoreboard glory, there's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_effect
">ostrich effect</a> here: doing science (from basic HR to equipment logistics) is going to get substantially harder. I'm no radical, but am starting to see why <a href="https://scientistrebellion.com/">some scientists</a> have decided to break out of everyday complaining and do something more substantial.
<br>
<br>

That said, I have also been <em>really encouraged</em> by the exploding science and societal movement to thread the needle to a sustainable future. The work of this movement exudes for me a vision and resolve that is characteristic of the best of the human spirit. Make no mistake, the stakes are everything and we are fighting against the odds (of what we were capable of in the absence of such a colossal emergency, so maybe those odds are not relevant here). Nevertheless, in the spirit of Marie Curie, I feel empowered after this learning process to act and maybe you can be too.
<br>
<br> Another great way for many to get empowered (especially for those that don't want or need to know the problem in all its detail) is by sharing your story, and sniffing around for where you are motivated to contribute by joining groups in your community or online forums. There is something ACTIONABLE for everyone!
<br>

<h0 id="AIclimpublications" padding=0>Artificial Intelligence (AI) startups and climate change</h0>
<br>
<br>
Let me start with a quick shout to my corner of the world. The climate change start-up scene is exploding and AI is jumping on board. The main resources to start engaging this community are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/">My Climate Journey</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://workonclimate.org/">Work on Climate</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://community.climatechange.ai/home">Climate Change AI</a> (<em>Mila</em> founders!)</li>
</ul>
Like on any bandwagon, there will be grifters. The pervasiveness of tech solutionism in the community means it's probably worse here, so I would just urge my AI colleagues to be discerning in the initiatives they choose to put energy into. That said, AI could play a big role in useful climate tech.

<br>
<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>The Stereotypical Positions</h0>
<br>
<br>
Ideally, the future climate movement will combine the best parts of each of these 3 main contemporary camps:
<br>
<br>
Degrowthers:
<ul>
<li> Pro: A sustainability-oriented society is where we need to end up.</li>
<li> Con: Unclear how to overcome high initial social & structural barriers.
</li>
</ul>
Ecomodernists:
<ul>
<li> Pro: Markets are powerful forces for the innovation we need.</li>
<li> Con: ‘Move fast and break things’-model is value-misaligned and fails often.
</li>
</ul>
Deep Adaptationists:
<ul>
<li> Pro: We need a psychology that empowers in face of climate emergency. </li>
<li> Con: Near total societal collapse is often baked in as an axiom. That's unjustified given current uncertainties.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h0 id="videos" padding=0>4-Part Video Series on the Growth Crisis</h0>
<br>
<br>
Global warming (what climate change really means) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wickedest</a> of problems! It is masked in myriad ways and exploits the deepest flaws in our society's and our own capacity to adapt. Contextualized as a nasty side-effect of conventional growth economics, I've made a series of four research videos that outline the problem. The last one is about how I think my skillset can contribute.

<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>Take-aways</h0>
<br>
<br>

Economics:
<ul>
<li> Neo-classical economic analyses systematically underestimate climate risk so take those projections as overly optimistic. </li>
<li> A significant portion of the financial industry see the value that will be lost in a business as usual projection. They are mostly on board with large, asset-stranding changes.</li>
<li> The fossil fuel industry lobby has, however, been effective at protecting their intention to continue production into the next decades. </li>
<li>It is mostly cheap oil, rather human ingenuity that supports our high rates of consumption.</li> 
<li> Cheap oil is waning and energy sources are diversifying. The latter aren't as rich as oil, so expect economic contraction globally, because the viability of many business models depend on cheap energy and a low cost of carbon. This will likely impact our efforts to further develop and deploy renewable energy.</li>
<li> The degree to which economic growth can be decoupled from physical resources is under debate. This debate is steeped in a lot of latent ideology.  
    </li>
</ul>

Technology:
<ul>
    <li>Climate solutions must scale well to be useful (e.g. rely on efficient and accessible resource). Very few do. Efficiency claims should be based on the entire process.</li>
<li> Be skeptical of Tech solutionism. That model hasn't proved itself yet in these large-scale, poorly grounded coordination problems, and "moving fast and breaking things" is a philosophy that actively generates and ignores externalities, which is largely what got us here. </li>
</ul>

Energy Sector:
<ul>
    <li> Era of cheap oil is coming to an end. Peak production is in a decade or so, followed by gradual decline.</li>
    <li>There's consensus coal needs to be phased out but large and increasing consumption in India and China is offsetting coal reductions elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

Politics:
<ul>
<li> It's mostly domestic lobbying and economic interests that shapes the climate policies politicians push for.</li>
<li> Fossil fuel producing nations are increasingly autocratic. They will exert control over pricing and production rates to slow-burn and profit as much as possible from any coherent transition.</li>
<li> As our institutions become more pliable in response to the calls for change, all actors will try to manipulate the process to their advantage. We need increased institutional agility, not reduced institutional presence.</li>
<li> As we saw with the pandemic response, solutions are not enough. The implementation is equally important. We need to translate the vision and commitment we currently have at large scale global scales back down to the scales of nations and peoples. </li>
</ul>

Beliefs/Feelings:
<ul>
<li> Collectively, we are uninformed. In the developed world, we think climate change is about personal choices not systemic change.</li>
<li> Concern about climate change and even knowledge about it isn't a great predictor of what changes we are willing to accept.</li>
<li> We seem to want an effective and fair transition, for others and for ourselves.</li>
<li> We are more swayed by explanations of how proposed policies do this rather than by explanations of the climate impacts these policies aim to mitigate. We are also swayed our culpability, when communicated clearly. </li>
<li> Feelings and values influence our decision-making and will affect how we evaluate explanations of outcomes.</li>
</ul>

Biosphere:
<ul>
<li> A mass extinction event was already underway independent of the effects of climate change due to human activities like habitat destruction. </li>
<li> Climate change accelerates and exacerbates this trend, with half of all (pre-industrial) species going extinct by 2050.</li>
<li> The Arctic marine ecosystem is in the process of being completely destroyed by the loss of sea ice (on the underside of which is the algae forming the bottom of its food chain).</li>
<li> The southwest of the Amazon rain forest will likely transition to savannah by 2050.</li> 
</ul>

Climate:
<ul>
<li>It is important to remember (if you have the space for it), that net-0 CO2 and reduced atmospheric temperature is an important target, but not the whole story. The fundamental symptom of the crisis is the earth energy imbalance: more greenhouse gases in our atmosphere mean that less of the energy we absorb from the sun is radiated away so the earth (mostly the oceans) are absorbing this excess heat (<a href="https://4hiroshimas.info/#Science">4 Hiroshima bombs worth/second</a>!). There are other greenhouse gases (like methane) and there are other consequences to climate (ocean warming) that we also need to keep in mind.  
<li> While the convention is to track climate change with average temperature increase, it is the weather variability that is also growing in most locations and is the largest source of risk. Even short heatwaves, if strong, can have lasting effects on the population and crops.</li>
<li> Strongest effects are heterogeneously distributed over the planet and capacity to adapt at a given location depends on socio-economic status up to a point. Unlikely any group or place will come out better than they are now. The typical case will be significantly worse.</li>
<li> In many cases, the change in official projections year by year continue to be in the worsening direction. The IPCC report only <a href="https://climatetippingpoints.info/2021/10/31/ipcc-ar6-climate-tipping-points-feedbacks/">started discussing</a> tipping points in earnest last year, of which many seem to be approaching much faster than anticipated.</li>
<li> CO2 emissions have been coupled with aerosol emissions, which have masked and delayed the full warming and precipitation effects. Temperatures are likely to rise more quickly in the coming years as we emit less aerosols. Let's not get frazzled by this and instead prepare adaptation measures now.</li>
<li> Geo-engineering to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere will likely be necessary. Geo-engineering to manage solar radiation in the meantime will also be needed (See the schematic below from MacMartin & Kravitz <em>PNAS</em> (2018)). There are still many unknowns, so we need a Manhattan project for this and, when deemed necessary, start with the safest, accessible approaches.</li>
