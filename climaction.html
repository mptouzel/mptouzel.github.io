<em>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</em> 
<br>- Marie Curie
<br>
<br>
Are you overwhelmed by climate change? So was I, and I didn't even know what it was, other than probably a very hard and important problem. I wondered: what meaningful action can we (you and I) take as individuals? 
<br>
<br>
This page is the place where you can find descriptions and links to resources that I find helpful in wrapping my head around climate change and what we can do about it. The worst cases are as bad or worse than I imagined and I've been disheartened at the degree to which ideology in our institutions seems to have contributed to us walking into this crisis. I have also been <em>really encouraged (dare I say optimistic?)</em> by the exploding science and societal movement to thread the needle to a sustainable world. It exudes a vision and resolve characteristic of the best of the human spirit. In the spirit of Marie Curie, I feel empowered by that knowledge to act and maybe you can be too.

<h0 id="videos" padding=0>4-Part Video Series on the Growth Crisis</h0>
<br>
<br>
Global warming (what climate change really means) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wickedest</a> of problems! It is masked in myriad ways and exploits the deepest flaws in our society's and our own capacity to adapt. Contextualized as a nasty side-effect of conventional growth economics, I've made a series of four research videos that outline the problem as I see it. The last one is about how I think my skillset can contribute.

<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>Take-aways</h0>
<br>
<br>

Economics:
<ul>
<li> Neo-classical analyses systematically underestimate climate risk so take those projections as overly optimistic. </li>
<li> A significant portion of the financial industry see the value that will be lost in a business as usual projection. They are mostly on board with large, asset-stranding changes.</li>
<li> The fossil fuel industry lobby has, however, been effective at protecting their intention to continue production into the next decades. </li>
<li>It is mostly cheap oil, rather human ingeniuty that supports our high rates of consumption.</li> 
<li> Cheap oil is waning and energy sources are diversifying. The latter aren't as rich as oil, so expect economic contraction globally, because the viability of many business models depend on cheap energy and a low cost of carbon.</li>
</ul>

Technology:
<ul>
    <li>Climate solutions must scale well to be useful (e.g. rely on efficient and accessible resource). Very few do. Efficiency claims should be based on the entire process.</li>
<li> Be skeptical of Tech solutionism. That model hasn't proved itself yet in these large-scale, poorly grounded coordination problems, and "moving fast and breaking things" is a philosophy that actively generates and ignores externalities, which is largely what got us here. </li>
</ul>

Energy:
<ul>
    <li> Era of cheap oil is coming to an end. Peak production is in a decade or so, followed by gradual decline.</li>
    <li>There's concensus coal needs to be phased out but large and increasing consumption in India and China is offsetting coal reductions elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

Politics:
<ul>
<li> It's mostly domestic lobbying and economic interests that shapes the climate policies politicians push for.</li>
<li> Fossil fuel producing nations are increasingly autocratic. They will exert control over pricing and production rates to slow-burn and profit as much as possible from any coherent transition.</li>
<li> As our institutions become more pliable in response to the calls for change, all actors will try to manipulate the process to thier advantage. We need increased institutional agility, not reduced institutional presence.</li>
<li> As we saw with the pandemic response, solutions are not enough. The implementation is equally important. We need to translate the vision and resolve we currently have at large scale global scales back down to the scales of nations and peoples. </li>
</ul>

Beliefs/Feelings:
<ul>
<li> Collectively, we are misinformed. In the developed world, we think climate change is about personal choices not systemic change.</li>
<li> Concern about climate change and even knowledge about it isn't a great predictor of what changes we are willing to accept.</li>
<li> We seem to want an effective and fair transition, for others and for ourselves.</li>
<li> We are more swayed by explanations of how proposed policies do this rather than by explanations of the climate impacts these policies aim to mitigate.</li>
<li> Feelings and values influence our decision-making and will affect how we evaluate explanations of outcomes.</li>
</ul>

Nature:
<ul>
<li> A mass extinction event was already underway independent of the effects of climate change due to human activities like habitat destruction. </li>
<li> Climate change accelerates and exacerbates this trend, with half of all (pre-industrial) species going extinct by 2050.</li>
<li> The Arctic marine ecosystem is in the process of being completely destroyed by the loss of sea ice (on the underside of which is the algae forming the bottom of its food chain).</li>
<li> The southwest of the Amazon rain forest will likely transition to savannah by 2050.</li> 
</ul>
</ul>

Climate:
<ul>
<li> Weather variability is growing in most locations and is the largest source of risk. Even short heatwaves, if strong, can have lasting effects on the population and crops.</li>
<li> Strongest effects are heterogenously distributed over the planet and capacity to adapt at a given location depends on socio-economic status. Unlikely any group or place will come out better than they are now. The typical case will be significantly worse.</li>
<li> Official projections are optimistic. Not even the IPCC reports account for tipping points, of which many seem to be approaching much faster than anticipated.</li>
<li> CO2 emissions have been coupled with aerosol emissions, which have masked and delayed the full warming and precipitation effects. Temperatures are likely to rise more quickly in the coming years as we emit less aerosols. Let's not get frazzled by this and instead prepare adaptation measures now.</li>
<li> Geo-engineering to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere will likely be necessary. Geo-engineering to manage solar radiation in the meantime will also be needed. There are still many unknowns, so we need a Manhatten project for this and, when deemed necessary, start with the safest, accessible approaches.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>The stereotypical positions</h0>
<br>
<br>
Ideally, the future climate movement will combine the best parts of each of these:

Degrowthers:
<ul>
<li> Pro: A sustainability-oriented society is where we need to end up.</li>
<li> Con: Unclear how to overcome high initial social & structural barriers.
</li>
</ul>
Ecomodernists:
<ul>
<li> Pro: Markets are powerful forces for the innovation we need.</li>
<li> Con: ‘Move fast and break things’-model is value-misaligned and fails often.
</li>
</ul>
Deep Adaptationists:
<ul>
<li> Pro: We need a psychology that empowers in face of climate emergency. </li>
<li> Con: Near total collapse is baked into the premise. That's unjustified given current uncertainties.
</li>
</ul>
