<em>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</em>
<br>- Marie Curie
<br>
<br>
I was starting to see mainstream, credentialed experts giving 10-20 year timelines for last-chance, system-changing climate action. How could that be true? Many institutions have plans that extend into and even beyond that time frame, and most have no stated intention to make the kind of drastic and urgent action merited by being on the precipice of the end of civilization. Heck, my own career aspirations and those of most professionals I know extend into that time frame. Is climate change really going to kibosh them all? "That <em>can't</em> be true," I thought. And yet, I found myself thinking about climate change often but without much of an understanding of what it was, other than probably a very hard and important problem. I finally got fed up with not knowing. If this is really something that reasonable people think is going to determine the future of everything, then it's relevant to every career-aspiring professional and to any career I would want to pursue! So, I set out to learn about it, at least enough to be able to answer the question: 
<br>
<br>
<b><em>What are the projections and what action can we as individuals and as members of larger collectives take that is meaningful, accessible, and effective?</em></b>
<br>
<br>
I sought answers that resonated with my expertise in quantitative analysis and decision-making research. They should (1) be firmly supported by data with transparent and unbiased, if large uncertainty estimates and (2) acknowledge the constraints imposed by the complicated incentive structure emerging from the contemporary socio-economic/geo-political order and the ego/social/affective/biased/effort-avoiding tendencies of human behaviour.
<br>
<br>
<b><em>This page is a synthesis of what I have learned about climate change and what we can do about it. </em></b>
<br>
<br> Loading up with all the detail of a problem is my preference. It won't be everyone's. It's certainly not a prerequisite to act. Other ways to get empowered are by sharing your own story through receptive channels, joining groups in your community or online forums, and sniffing around for where you are motivated to contribute. There is something ACTIONABLE for everyone! Find <a href="https://www.jtolio.com/2022/07/anthropocene-calamity-part-4-your-pie-chart-looks-different-than-others/
">your highest point of leverage</a>.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
Here's the <b><em>TL;DR Summary</em></b> on the state of the climate emergency:
<ul>
<li><u><em>The physical source of the problem is simple: an Earth Energy Imbalance</em></u>. The earth absorbs light energy from the sun and re-emits energy as heat back into space. A fraction of this heat is trapped on earth by greenhouse gases (GHGs). How much? 0.87 + 0.12 Joule/second/meter<sup>2</sup>. This is alot! It's an energy rate equivalent to every 10x10 km<sup>2</sup> land area on Earth getting hit every 2 weeks by a <a href="https://youtu.be/3wxWNAM8Cso?list=RDCMUC2ccm1GajfSujz7T18d7cKA&t=214">Hiroshima bomb</a>, with total blast area covering all the land on Earth every 6 months. Most of this heat is actually absorbed by the oceans, but that capacity isn't limitless, is having its own cascading sequence of negative consequences, and the relatively small remainder that gets absorbed by the land and atmosphere is still large enough to present an existential problem for us. We need to lower the GHG concentration in the atmosphere so more heat can escape. Instead, <b>we are increasing GHG concentration by burning fossil fuels, which traps more heat.</b></li>
<br>
<li><u><em>It's worse than you think.</em></u> The underlying physical and socio-political mechanisms at play in climate change make the worst case projections both more probable and worse than I imagined and the year-to-year adjustments in projected timelines for serious changes keep moving closer. Tending to be situated in more affected regions and with less means to protect themselves, more and more poor countries are seeing the effects of climate change. Changes to the world order and everyday life that you wouldn't have imagined are starting to pop up this decade even for rich countries and they will become more frequent over the next 10-20 years. These near-term changes are largely unavoidable given that climate responds slowly over decades. Things can get much worse though. By mid-century, it's very likely that on our current business-as-usual trajectory we will see changes compound into what will mark the beginning of the end of our civilization as we know it (conflict-causing mass migration and food shortages from regions made uninhabitable/infertile, irreparable dysregulation of the global economy, etc.). Civilization on this trajectory will be a rapidly decomposing shell of itself coming out of this century. <b>The meaningful action for us to take now is what prevents that collapse from happening.</b> </li>
<br>
<li> <u><em>There are still credible paths forward that avoid collapse. They demand systemic change, soon, the seeds of which are being sowed now.</em></u>
After decades of not getting much attention, the vibrant science and societal movement to thread the needle to a sustainable future is burgeoning and now seems poised to make real headway. The work of this movement exudes for me a vision and resolve that is characteristic of the best of the human spirit. It gives me hope that preventing collapse is a realistic goal worth going all-in on. Make no mistake, the stakes are everything and the hard work is ahead of us. We are fighting against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wickedest</a> of problems: the imposing cynicism of autocratic petrostates, the distracted governance of emerging populism, and the soothing, but deluded doctrine of continued growth through technological innovation. Nevertheless, in the spirit of Marie Curie, better understanding this complex arena allows us to form and execute better shots at success. I feel empowered by this idea to act out of my comfort zone and maybe you can be too. There's no sugar-coating it: if you live in comfort and yet are not now acting out of your comfort zone on the climate emergency then you are contributing to the problem. Even worse: by staying complacent now, you are complicit in the current inertia that will destroy most everything of permanence you ever cared about (soon enough for you to watch it happen if you live another 40 years), and are effectively condemning most living things (e.g. your offspring) to terror-filled, short lives. <b>Embrace the discomfort, and channel it into action that resolves it.</b> </li>
</ul>
<!-- I've been disheartened at the degree to which ideology in our institutions (finally now shifting) seems to have contributed to us walking into this crisis. I am also frustrated by the Academy's lack of bold action. Climate change poses a credible existential threat and yet we academics are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_effect
">keeping our heads in the sand</a>. I'm no radical, but understand why <a href="https://scientistrebellion.com/">some scientists</a> have decided to break out of everyday complaining and do something more substantial. This page is a small attempt at seeding more and greater action.<br>-->

<h0 id="AIclimpublications" padding=0>Artificial Intelligence (AI) startups and climate change</h0>
<br>
<br>
Let me start with a quick shout-out to my corner of the world. The climate change start-up scene is exploding and AI is jumping on board. The main resources to start engaging this community are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/">My Climate Journey</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://workonclimate.org/">Work on Climate</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://community.climatechange.ai/home">Climate Change AI</a></li>
</ul>
Like on any bandwagon, there will be grifters. The pervasiveness of Tech solutionism in the community means it's probably worse here, so I would just urge my AI colleagues to be discerning in the initiatives they choose to put energy into. That said, I do think AI could play a big role in useful transition tech&mdash;things like optimizing measurement sensing, energy efficiency, and BioTech. Given my training and research experience, I've specialized on the less prevalent, but I think equally important applications of AI in social science and social technologies.<br>
<br>
The research field of AI alignment/safety obviously concerns future risk, but tends to downplay climate change in favor of current and especially soonish AI technologies. The AGI and effective altruist/long-termist crowds take this position to the extreme. In my opinion, the infrastructure and human research resources on which the development of AGI depends, even for near-term AGI timelines, will not be maintained through the economic disruption in a business-as-usual projection, so I don't consider AGI a credible threat in the near term. My biggest concern for near term AI impact is simply the continued active and passive manipulation of public opinion by the existing AI-powered algorithms behind social media platforms, and to a lesser degree automated weapon systems.
</p>
<br>
<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>The Stereotypical Positions</h0>
<br>
<br>
Ideally, the future climate movement will combine the best parts of each of these 3 main contemporary camps:
<br>
<br>
<em>Degrowthers</em>: Reduce consumption. Preserve the natural world that sustains us.
<ul>
<li> Pro: The right goal. A sustainability-oriented society is where we need to end up.</li>
<li> Con: Unclear how to overcome high initial social & structural barriers.
</li>
</ul>
<em>Ecomodernists</em>: Innovate technological solutions powered by further growth.
<ul>
<li> Pro: Powerful means. Markets (for capitalists) and emancipated Labour (for socialists) are powerful forces for the massive technological innovation we need to transition off fossil fuels.</li>
<li> Con: Unclear how to globally decouple this growth from resource use (risking the collapse of the ecosystem, including human life).
</li>
</ul>
<em>Deep Adaptationists</em>: Not salvageable. Accept what's coming and focus on reducing harm.
<ul>
<li> Pro: Counter-intuitively, an activating psychology. We need a psychology that empowers in face of climate emergency. </li>
<li> Con: Near total societal collapse is often baked in as an axiom. That's unjustified and distracting given current uncertainties.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- Global warming (what climate change really means) is the  of problems! It is masked in myriad ways and exploits the deepest flaws in our society's and our own capacity to adapt. --> 
Contextualized as a nasty side-effect of conventional growth economics, I've made a series of four research videos that outline the problem. The last one is about how I think my skillset can contribute.

<h0 id="TAs" padding=0>Take-aways</h0>
<br>
<br>
(Any such list will necessarily be incomplete. What's in it also depends on who wrote it. This one by me is no different. I'll be adding more reference links here over time. If you want one that's not there yet, let me know. If you think I am missing a main point, do contact me.)
<br>
<br>
Economics/Finance:
<ul>
<li> Neo-classical economic analyses <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856?journalCode=rglo20">systematically underestimate</a> climate risk so take those projections as overly optimistic. </li>
<li> A <a href="https://www.ngfs.net/en">significant portion</a> of the financial industry regulators see the value that will be lost in a business-as-usual projection. They are mostly on board with large, asset-stranding changes.</li>
<li> While a price on pollution is unpopular, it is the best economic device we have. Instead of sticks, carrot (i.e. positive reward)-based policy is in the works, e.g. a <a href="https://globalcarbonreward.org/carbon-currency/">carbon coin/currency</a>. 
<li> The fossil fuel industry lobby has, however, been effective at protecting their intention to continue production into the next decades, e.g. the concessions made to them in the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/18/climate-change-inflation-reduction-act-oil-gas/7837956001/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> that further develops the renewable energy sector. </li>
<li> The degree to which economic growth can be decoupled from physical resources is a complex, ideology-laden debate (the two sides even differ in <a href="https://twitter.com/ryankatzrosene/status/1575197065575272448?s=20&t=Y8ORKZdvx-K2ZeUUML4cjg">what decoupling means</a>) that nevertheless seems to have an empirical resolution: there are lots of examples of partial decoupling (e.g. within the economies of specific nations, even when exported emissions are included), but the kind of global decoupling that would make current rates of growth consistent with a sustainable future <a href="https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Decoupling-Debunked.pdf">seems unlikely</a>. </li>
<!-- <li>It is mostly cheap oil, rather human ingenuity that supports the high rates of consumption in the developed world.</li>  -->
<li> Cheap oil is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261921011673">waning</a> and energy sources are diversifying. The latter aren't as rich as oil though, so expect economic contraction globally, because the viability of many business models and lifestyles depend on cheap energy and a low cost of carbon. This economic contraction will likely <a href="https://dro.dur.ac.uk/36769/1/36769.pdf?DDD35+khcv89+vbdv77">adversely impact our efforts</a> to further develop and deploy renewable energy.</li>
    </li>
</ul>

Technology:
<ul>
    <li>Climate solutions must scale well to be useful (e.g. rely on efficient and accessible resource). Very few do. Efficiency claims should be based on the entire manufacturing and product life cycle process.</li>
<li> Be skeptical of Tech solutionism. That model hasn't proved itself yet in these large-scale, poorly grounded coordination problems, and "moving fast and breaking things" is a philosophy that actively generates and ignores externalities, which is largely what got us here. </li>
</ul>

Energy Sector:
<ul>
    <li> Era of cheap oil is coming to an end. <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-26372-4">Peak production</a> is in a decade or so, followed by gradual decline.</li>
    <li>There's consensus coal needs to be phased out but large and increasing consumption in India and China is offsetting coal reductions elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Scope 1 (emissions from inputs) and 2 (emissions in production) of the Energy sector are large, but still dwarf scope 3 (emissions from output product) - the processed fossil fuel itself. There are lots of means for the sector to evade emissions reduction. For example, as <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24102022/fossil-fuels-private-equity/">dirty assets become a liability</a>, there will always buyers and these present their own problems. </li>
</ul>

Politics:
<ul>
<li> Given <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/20/4/4/95068/Prisoners-of-the-Wrong-Dilemma-Why-Distributive">the track record</a>, it's mostly domestic lobbying and economic interests that shape climate policies political leaders campaign on and push for.</li>
<li> Domestic climate politics is increasing partisan with support for climate policies such as carbon pricing divided along ideological lines.
<li> Fossil-fuel producing nations are increasingly autocratic/oligarchic and kleptocratic. They will exert control over pricing via rates of production to slow-burn the extraction of as much of their remaining reserves as possible to maximize their profits. Avoiding civilizational collapse needs most of these reserves to stay in the ground. These actors are thus perhaps the largest impediment to mitigating climate change. The emerging alliance between Russia and Saudi Arabia is a timely example of large producers/emitters that will be hard for the international community to compel to leave reserves in the ground. </li>
<li> As our institutions become more pliable in response to the calls for change, all actors will try to manipulate the process to their advantage. We need increased institutional strength and agility, not reduced institutional oversight.</li>
<li> As we saw with the pandemic response, a good solution can fail to be implemented effectively. We need to translate the vision and commitment we currently have at large scale global scales back down to the scales of nations and peoples. </li>
</ul>

Beliefs/Feelings:
<ul>
<li> Collectively, we are uninformed. In the developed world, we think climate change is about personal choices not systemic change.</li>
<li> Concern about climate change and even knowledge about it isn't a great predictor of what changes we are willing to accept.</li>
<li> We seem to want an effective and fair transition, for others and for ourselves.</li>
<li> We are more swayed by explanations of how proposed policies do this rather than by explanations of the climate impacts these policies aim to mitigate. We are also swayed our culpability, when communicated clearly. </li>
<li> Feelings and values influence our decision-making and will affect how we evaluate explanations of outcomes.</li>
</ul>

Biosphere:
<ul>
<li> A mass extinction event was already underway independent of the effects of climate change due to human activities like habitat destruction. </li>
<li> Climate change accelerates and exacerbates this trend, with an estimated half of all (pre-industrial) species going extinct by 2050. </li>
<li> Two stark examples: (1) the Arctic marine ecosystem may be completely destroyed by the loss of sea ice (on the underside of which is the algae forming the bottom of its food chain), and (2) the southwest of the Amazon rain forest will likely transition to savannah by 2050.</li>
<li> The biosphere's resilience is collective, so it is an important goal to do what is possible to conserve remaining species and habitats.</li> 
</ul>

Climate:
<ul>
<li>It is important to remember that net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> and the eventual reduced atmospheric temperature is an important target, but not the whole story. The fundamental symptom of the crisis is the <em>Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI)</em>: more greenhouse gases in our atmosphere mean that less of the energy we absorb from the sun is radiated away so the earth (mostly the oceans) are absorbing this excess heat (<a href="https://4hiroshimas.info/#Science">4 Hiroshima bombs worth/second</a>!). There are other greenhouse gases (like methane) and there are other consequences to climate (ocean warming) that we also need to keep in mind. Temperature changes can also have large effects on how bodies absorb or give off carbon dioxide (e.g. there are large and consequential uncertainties in how land-based carbon sinks are going to respond to warming going forward).
<li> While the convention is to track climate change with average temperature increase, it is the weather variability that is also growing in most locations and is the largest source of risk to us. For example, heatwaves, even short ones if strong, can have lasting effects on the human population and the crops that sustain it.</li>
<li> Strongest effects are heterogeneously distributed over the planet and capacity to adapt at a given location depends on socio-economic status up to a point. Unlikely any group or place will come out better than they are now. The typical case will be significantly worse.</li>
<li> In many cases, the change in official projections year by year continue to be in the worsening direction. The IPCC report only <a href="https://climatetippingpoints.info/2021/10/31/ipcc-ar6-climate-tipping-points-feedbacks/">started discussing</a> tipping points in earnest last year, of which many seem to be approaching <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abn7950">much faster than anticipated</a>.</li>
<li> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been coupled with aerosol emissions, which have masked and delayed the full warming and precipitation effects. Temperatures are likely to rise more quickly in the coming years as we emit less aerosols. Let's not get frazzled by this and instead prepare adaptation measures now.</li>
<li> Geo-engineering to pull CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere will likely be necessary. Geo-engineering to reflect sunlight away in the meantime will also be needed (See the schematic below from MacMartin & Kravitz <em>PNAS</em> (2018)). There are still many unknowns, so we need a Manhattan project for this and, when deemed necessary, start with the safest, accessible approaches.</li>
</ul>
