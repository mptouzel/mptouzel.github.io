<h1 >Motivation</h1>

    How do we abstract the world in a way that facilitates choosing actions to achieve a goal? How does the uncertainty in our beliefs about the world transform into uncertainty about how valuable are the actions we can take in it? Why do we sometimes make the effort to reduce this uncertainty, while other times we simply account for it, or even neglect it outright, even at our peril? These questions illustrate <b> the complex interplay between efficiently representating the world and profitably acting in it</b>. They also point to a central question: <b>how do we form and select goals to pursue?</b> We are a social species, and social and identity factors can play a dominant role in this process within an individual, but also collectively within a society.

<!-- 
<p>
    Dynamics as iterates in an data-driven learning algorithm, ongoing neural activity, or agent-environment interaction is central to this interplay. I am interested in <b> how the dynamics of learning agents (be it humans, other animals, or machines) implement decision-making.</b> 
    An exciting space for these questions lies in the intersection of neural dynamics, reinforcement learning, and the cognitive and systems neuroscience of decision-making. I develop theoretical and computational approaches in collaboration with diverse experimental groups.

<!-- <h1 id="CV">CV</h1> -->
<p>
    Many of the pressing societal problems of our time, from extremism to climate change action, rest on how we form beliefs while consuming information and dialoguing in social venues, increasingly curated by algorithms, on a range of scales from peer-to-peer extending to large, online communities. The form of the information exchanged in these fundamentally social interactions and the form of the mediums over which they occur can play a role in the collective decisions we make as a society through the way they bias how individuals decide what to believe.
    <!--I am currently working with cognitive neuroscientists and psychologists on the dynamics of human decision-making and how it impacts the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566677/human-compatible-by-stuart-russell/">AI alignment problem</a>. -->
    <!-- How can we quantify how we assess risk and how this capacity develops? -->
    <!-- As a mathematical theory of agent-environment interactions, reinforcement learning is useful when interpreting human decision-making.  -->
</p>
 <h1 >The Work</h1>
 <p>
    I am currently collaborating with psychologists and social scientists in order to tease apart the interplay of belief, identity, and decision-making bias through laboratory experiments and population data. By better accounting for the effects of the social milieu in which individuals come to believe who they are and what is important to them, we can better align the algorithms that structure our collective discourse, as well as develop prosocial, assistive technologies in that space. Check out an <a href="https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/soc-rldm/home">upcoming RLDM workshop</a> I am co-organizing on this topic
    <!--through decision-making tasks and large questionnaires. Using climate change as an application, I have also begun research into how this risk assessment is impacted by our existing beliefs.-->
</p>
<p>
    Decision-making and belief formation is an ongoing-process not easily accessed via single tasks performed in restrictive environments. I am currently funded under the Canadian Excellence Research Chair in autonomous AI held by Irina Rish. With students in her group, we analyze the subtle dynamics that emerge in multi-agent, continual reinforcement learning settings, providing a sandbox to help understand complex social decision-making phenomena in natural systems.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I have a long-standing interest in statistical physics and, in particular, using it to understand the information processing of a given system dynamics. One aim is to further ground biological and machine learning in physical dynamics by extending the formalism of information thermodynamics to these settings. Here, a thermodynamics of the system reveals information processing as buried in the system's entropy production.

<h2 >Example Projects</h2>

<!-- Two current applications I am excited about are: -->
<ul>
    <li>Using topic correlations inferred from open-ended responses to questionnaires about climate change beliefs (here about a tax on carbon) in pursuit of better climate and policy communication. Below is a projection of the learned topic model onto 2 topics (red/blue). (Note this corpus has been stemmed so 'reduc' here accounts for 'reduction', 'reducing', etc.). [with E. Lachapelle (SciPo, UdeM)]</li>

    <li>Using reward maps inferred with inverse reinforcement learning from dynamic-risk task behaivour as an efficient, language-free proxy for subject impulsivity scores. [with P. Cisek (Neuroscience, UdeM)]</li>
