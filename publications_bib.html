  abstract = {Synaptic interactions structure the phase space of the dynamics of neural circuits and constrain neural computation. Understanding how requires methods that handle those discrete interactions, yet few exist. Recently, it was discovered that even random networks exhibit dynamics that partitions the phase space into numerous attractor basins. Here we utilize this phenomenon to develop theory for the geometry of phase space partitioning in spiking neural circuits. We find basin boundaries structuring the phase space are pre-images of spike-time collision events. Formulating a statistical theory of spike-time collision events, we derive expressions for the rate of divergence of neighboring basins and for their size distribution. This theory reveals that the typical basin diameter grows with inhibitory coupling strength and shrinks with the rate of spike events. Our study provides an analytical and generalizable approach for dissecting how connectivity, coupling strength, single neuron dynamics and population activity shape the phase space geometry of spiking circuits.},

  abstract = {The response of a neuronal population over a space of inputs depends on the intrinsic properties of its constituent neurons. Two main modes of single neuron dynamics–integration and resonance–have been distinguished. While resonator cell types exist in a variety of brain areas, few models incorporate this feature and fewer have investigated its effects. To understand better how a resonator's frequency preference emerges from its intrinsic dynamics and contributes to its local area's population firing rate dynamics, we analyze the dynamic gain of an analytically solvable two-degree of freedom neuron model. In the Fokker-Planck approach, the dynamic gain is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting of the voltage after a spike. This allows us to derive a complete expression for the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model in terms of a cascade of filters on the input. We find six distinct response types and use them to fully characterize the routes to resonance across all values of the relevant timescales. We find that resonance arises primarily due to slow adaptation with an intrinsic frequency acting to sharpen and adjust the location of the resonant peak. We determine the parameter regions for the existence of an intrinsic frequency and for subthreshold and spiking resonance, finding all possible intersections of the three. The expressions and analysis presented here provide an account of how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape dynamic population response properties and can facilitate the construction of an exact theory of correlations and stability of population activity in networks containing populations of resonator neurons... Dynamic gain, the amount by which features at specific frequencies in the input to a neuron are amplified or attenuated in its output spiking, is fundamental for the encoding of information by neural populations. Most studies of dynamic gain have focused on neurons without intrinsic degrees of freedom exhibiting integrator-type subthreshold dynamics. Many neuron types in the brain, however, exhibit complex subthreshold dynamics such as resonance, found for instance in cortical interneurons, stellate cells, and mitral cells. A resonator neuron has at least two degrees of freedom for which the classical Fokker-Planck approach to calculating the dynamic gain is largely intractable. Here, we lift the voltage-reset rule after a spike, allowing us to derive a complete expression of the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model. We find the gain can exhibit only six shapes. The resonant ones have peaks that become large due to intrinsic adaptation and become sharp due to an intrinsic frequency. A resonance can nevertheless result from either property. The analysis presented here helps explain how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape population-level response properties and provides a powerful tool for developing theories of inter-neuron correlations and dynamic responses of neural populations.},

  abstract = {Cortical neurons operate within recurrent neuronal circuits. Dissecting their operation is key to understanding information processing in the cortex and requires transparent and adequate dynamical models of circuit function. Convergent evidence from experimental and theoretical studies indicates that strong feedback inhibition shapes the operating regime of cortical circuits. For circuits operating in inhibition-dominated regimes, mathematical and computational studies over the past several years achieved substantial advances in understanding response modulation and heterogeneity, emergent stimulus selectivity, inter-neuron correlations, and microstate dynamics. The latter indicate a surprisingly strong dependence of the collective circuit dynamics on the features of single neuron action potential generation. New approaches are needed to definitely characterize the cortical operating regime.},

  abstract = {Research in nonorthogonal-state discrimination has given rise to two conventional optimal strategies: unambiguous discrimination (UD) and minimum error discrimination. We explore the experimentally relevant range of measurement strategies between the two, where the rate of inconclusive results is minimized for a bounded-error rate. We first provide some constraints on the problem that apply to generalized measurements [positive-operator-valued measurements (POVMs)]. We then provide the theory for the optimal projective measurement in this range. Through analytical and numerical results we investigate this family of projective, bounded-error strategies and compare it to the POVM family as well as to experimental implementation of UD using POVMs. We also discuss a possible application of these bounded-error strategies to quantum key distribution.},
